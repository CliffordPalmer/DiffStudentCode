We spent the second half of class coming up with ideas. We cycled through a bunch of ideas before settling on one which we think should work. It uses a 2D array to tabulate smaller versions of the problem, and works based on moving one letter at a time in each string and checking for matches, at which point it cleverly adds to the running total stored in previously filled indexes. |
| February 27 |  8:55-9:55am  | Spent class implementing our solution. It wasn't too difficult, and aside from being suggested to use the clever technique of filling the first row and column with zeros, worked as we had planned from last class. It runs well within time too. for the second half of class, I worked on some of the additional challenges, namely returning the longest string. For this, instead of storing the length of the string at each index, I store the substring being built, and add to it every time there is a match between the two strings. It seems to work, as when I return the length of the stored substring, it passes the checks. |
